***Check Your Understanding
1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, because it's consistent in ensuring that your code works before anything is committed and overall makes for a clean process.


2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
- No, this is because E2E testing is used for ensuring functionality on the user's end rather than individual functions. 

3) What is the difference between navigation and snapshot mode?
- The difference is that navigation mode provides performance metrics of the website while snapshot mode is an analysis of the web page in that particular point in time. 

4) Name three things we could do to improve the CSE 110 shop site based on the Lighthouse results.
- provide meta description in document
- provide a lang attribute in the HTML
- properly size images to save more storage
